Part C: Solving Problems with Fingerprint Groups

1. Organizing Element Isotopes
 - Tracking radioactive decay in elements such as Calcium are critical in understanding isotopic behaviour in nuclear physics and chemistry. Datasets will generally be several thousand lines long, and each isotope will have different decay properties. Using fingerprint sorting, the isotopes could be quickly paired into a group and their individual behaviour would be easier to analyze.

2. Gravitational Wave Analysis
- A major topic of research in physics right now is gravtitational wave formation. There are many different types of waves and a particular research group will generally only be interested in one of these types. Wave dectectors such as the LIGO operation will collect vast amounts of data on potential gravitational wave forms, and these waves often happen extremely quickly. By grouping similar signals/events, scientists can quickly identify the specific wave patterns that are valuable towards their research.
